# this logged in user will have access to ssh into the target machine
ssh-keygen

# this will copy the public key and place it in the /root/.ssh/authorized_keys file
# make sure that if you use root in the below command that the ansible inventory 
# uses 'ansible_connection=ssh ansible_user=root'
ssh-copy-id root@<ip_of_target>

#test it out
